  "prompt": "Low-angle ground-level camera view positioned 15 centimeters above surface, moving forward at 0.5 meters per second along a bright yellow industrial safety tape line adhered to polished stainless steel floor. The tape line is 10 centimeters wide with reflective coating showing high gloss finish. The line follows a gentle radius curve bending left with approximately 20-meter turning radius. Camera maintains center position over the line throughout forward motion. Industrial warehouse interior with overhead fluorescent tube lights flickering irregularly at 50-60 Hz causing strobing effect and variable brightness. Polished metal floor creates intense specular reflections and mirror-like glare hotspots from overhead lights. High dynamic range scene with overexposed reflection areas and shadow regions. Yellow tape reflects light creating bloom and flare effects on camera lens. Metal floor shows scratches, scuff marks, and varying degrees of polish creating unpredictable reflection patterns. Camera height remains constant showing stable forward motion with yellow line staying centered despite visual interference from reflections. Natural camera shake from hard surface. Wide-angle industrial camera lens with 90-degree field of view showing lens flare artifacts. The reflective yellow line extends 5 meters ahead with multiple glare hotspots obscuring portions, curves smoothly leftward through varying lighting conditions. Automatic exposure adjustment visible as camera compensates for bright reflections. Realistic industrial robot motion physics with precise path following despite challenging visual conditions and flickering illumination creating intermittent visibility."
