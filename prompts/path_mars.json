  "prompt": "Low-angle ground-level camera view positioned 15 centimeters above surface, moving forward at 0.5 meters per second along a faded yellow-orange painted path on sandy reddish-brown Martian regolith surface. The path marking is 10 centimeters wide, partially covered by windblown red dust, showing weathered edges and intermittent visibility. The path follows a gentle radius curve bending left with approximately 20-meter turning radius. Camera maintains center position over the path throughout forward motion. Hazy atmosphere with diffuse orange-pink lighting from distant sun low on horizon creating soft shadows. Low contrast between faded yellow path and red-brown dusty surface. Surface shows fine sand particles, small rocks scattered randomly, and subtle ripple patterns from wind. Dust particles suspended in thin atmosphere create slight atmospheric scattering. Camera height remains constant showing stable forward motion with path staying centered in frame. Natural vibration from uneven terrain. Wide-angle lens with 90-degree field of view. The faded path extends 5 meters ahead with dust obscuring sections, curves smoothly leftward. Soft focus throughout due to atmospheric haze. Realistic rover motion physics with micro-adjustments for terrain variations and consistent forward speed despite reduced path visibility."
